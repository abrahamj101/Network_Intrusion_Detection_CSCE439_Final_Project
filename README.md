## Network Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning

Abstract - Network intrusion detection plays a critical role in securing computer networks against malicious attacks. Machine learning-based models offer a promising solution for detecting cyber intrusions by analyzing network traffic. In this paper, we investigate the performance of modern machine learning classifiers, specifically Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks, in improving the detection rate of cyber intrusions. Using the widely-recognized NSL-KDD dataset, we evaluate these modelsâ€™ accuracy in classifying network traffic as normal or intrusive. The paper presents preliminary results and a comparison of the performance of these classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with an emphasis on hyperparameter tuning to optimize results. While the results indicate that Random Forest is a strong performer, further optimization and evaluation are needed to confirm definitive conclusions.
